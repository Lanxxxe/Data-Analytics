1. Use pandas to read the file as a dataframe (named as books). bookID column should be the index of the dataframe.
2. Use books.head() to see the first 5 rows of the dataframe.
3. Use book.shape to find the number of rows and columns in the dataframe.
4. Use books.describe() to summarize the data.
5. Use books['authors'].describe() to find about the number of unique authors in the dataset and also the most frequent author.
6. Use OLS regression to test if the average rating of a book is dependent on the following three variables: number of pages,0
 number of ratings, and total number of written text reviews the book received. Use a single regression line with these three variables.

Clearly summarize and explain your findings in part 1 (all 6 sections: 1-1 to 1-6) in a Word file (you should include your code, 
and provide a summary of findings- for example, name of the most frequent author)
